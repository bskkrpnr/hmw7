# Exercise: Using the `concat()` Method in Java Strings

## Objective
Learn how to use the `concat()` method of the `String` class in Java to combine strings.

## Instructions

**Concatenate Strings Using the `concat()` Method**

In this exercise, you will create string variables and use the `concat()` method to combine them.

**For you to do:**

1. **Create String Variables**
   - Create a `String` variable named `s1` and assign the value `"Hello"` to it.
   - Create a `String` variable named `s2` and assign the value `"World"` to it.
   - Create a `String` variable named `s3` and assign an empty string `""` to it.

2. **Concatenate the Strings**
   - Use the `concat()` method to concatenate `s1` and `" "` (a space), and assign the result back to `s1`.
   - Use the `concat()` method to concatenate `s1` and `s2`, and assign the result to `s3`.

3. **Print the Results**
   - Print the value of `s3`.

## Example Output
```
Hello World
```

## Tips
- Ensure your string variables are declared and assigned correctly.
- Remember to use the correct syntax for calling the `concat()` method: `string1.concat(string2)`.
- To add a space between `s1` and `s2`, you can concatenate a space character `" "`.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the strings are concatenated correctly and that a space is included between the words.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `concat()` method in Java to combine strings. Happy coding!
